Things I want to mention: 
1.GENERAL Please run the webpage in the terminal by writing "yarn start" it runs way better.
2.There is a problem with the shopping cart that does not let me see the products added to the cart, but you see that the amount increases when you add something to the cart, I tried to fix the problem several times and no matter how much I tried, it simply does not show me the products I bought.

Thank you for reading and reviewing my React built website and I do hope very much that you like it :)
